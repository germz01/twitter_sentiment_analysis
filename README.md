# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Nowadays, when delving into the Social Network landscape, a user can choose among different paths, depending on the type of experience he/she is 
searching. Regardless the type of platform that is chosen by the user, either 
Facebook, or Instagram or Twitter, the amount of textual data that is produced 
every day is massive. With this report, I describe the project I developed for 
the Human Language Technologies class hosted by the University of Pisa's 
Master's Degree in Computer Science, that is, a prediction-oriented analysis 
of two datasets composed by labeled tweets, with the second one providing 
informations also on the tweets' topic, via a series of models like SVM, NB, 
CNN and LSTM.
