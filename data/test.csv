neutral,"Zlatan is looking mighty attractive at the moment,if LVG doesn't get a striker by Tuesday, I really don't fancy us scoring goals this season"
positive,"Wonder if Zlatan will be a United player come Tuesday night, think he may be the only realistic option of a big name signing."
negative,If there is a silver lining this shows LVG if we dont buy anyone b4 Tuesday we is fucked!! Fuck it i would take Zlatan!!
neutral,If Wenger is in Paris. Could it be for Cavani or Zlatan?Then again he may be on a family break.
positive,"Ok ed let's do this, Zlatan, greizmann and Laporte tomorrow make it happen"
neutral,Goal level: Zlatan  90k by Friday? = Posting every other day  #DSGS (Vine by @ElexAuerbach) https://t.co/BPUM3A8tSD
neutral,@YouAreMyArsenal Wouldn't surprise me if we enquired.He can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to Zlatan but he's not worth PSG asking price
neutral,Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC
neutral,"Noooooo! I was hoping to see Zlatan being Zlatan in Tuesday! Oh well, still looking forward to the match.  https://t.co/swGyd9cQAJ"
